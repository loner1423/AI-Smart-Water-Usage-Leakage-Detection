# AI-Based Smart Water Usage & Leakage Detection Assistant
AI-based Smart Water Usage and Leakage Detection Assistant aligned with SDG 6

## Internship
1M1B – IBM SkillsBuild AI for Sustainability Virtual Internship

## SDG Alignment
- Primary SDG: SDG 6 – Clean Water and Sanitation
- Secondary SDGs: SDG 11, SDG 12

## Problem Statement
Water scarcity and wastage are major sustainability challenges. Large quantities of water are lost due to unnoticed leakages, inefficient usage, and lack of awareness. Traditional systems fail to provide early detection or actionable insights.

How might we use AI to analyze water consumption patterns so that water usage becomes efficient and leakages are detected early?

## Proposed Solution
This project proposes an AI-powered Smart Water Usage and Leakage Detection Assistant that:
- Analyzes historical water usage data
- Detects abnormal consumption patterns indicating leakage
- Provides personalized water-saving recommendations
- Uses conversational AI for awareness and guidance

## Role of AI
- Pattern detection and anomaly detection
- Prompt engineering for conversational AI
- IBM Granite LLM for chatbot responses
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for water policies and conservation tips

## Workflow
1. User inputs daily or weekly water usage data
2. AI analyzes trends and historical patterns
3. Anomaly detection identifies unusual spikes
4. System generates alerts and recommendations
5. Chatbot answers user queries related to water conservation

### AI Workflow
![Workflow Diagram](flow.io)

## Sample Inputs
- Daily household water usage (in liters)
- User query: "How can I reduce water usage?"

## Sample Outputs
- "Your water usage is 30% higher than normal. Possible leakage detected."
- "Fixing tap leaks and using low-flow fixtures can save water."

## Responsible AI Considerations
- Fairness: Applicable to all users
- Transparency: Alerts are explainable
- Ethics: Advisory-only recommendations
- Privacy: No personal data stored

## Expected Impact
- Reduction in water wastage
- Early leakage detection
- Increased awareness of sustainable water usage
- Lower water bills

## Project Status
Conceptual prototype developed as per internship guidelines.
